[Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) - Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computer systems to learn by themselves without being programmed directly by a human. All of us regularly use machine learning in services like search engines, spam filters, product recommendations, online translation, and digital assistants.

[Scratch Extensions](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Scratch_Extension) - Scratch Extensions make it possible to connect Scratch projects with external hardware (such as LEGO WeDo or PicoBoard) or sources of information on the web. They add a collection of command and reporter blocks that can be used to interact with a particular device or data source. When an extension is enabled, its blocks appear in the "More Blocks" palette.
